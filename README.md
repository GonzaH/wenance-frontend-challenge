This is a webpage to see a collection of characters and some of their characteristics. The data is obtained from [swapi](https://swapi.dev/api/).

### How to run
Tools:
- npm: [download it following the instructions in this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- node: You'll need a 10+ version. If you don't have node installed you can do it via
  - nvm (which I personally recommend if you plan to use node on future projects) downloading it [here if you have linux/mac](https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/) or [here if you have windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
  - node directly from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

After having installed npm and node, run:
```
npm install
```
in the root of the project to install the dependencies.

To start the react app run:
```
npm run start
```
in the root of the project.

The webpage will be available at `localhost:8080` as root.

### External resources
- For the color pallette I used [this webpage, which I love](https://www.schemecolor.com), specifically [this pallette](https://www.schemecolor.com/mint-and-pink.php), it might not be the best one, but I wanted to try the combinations.
